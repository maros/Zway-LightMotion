# Zway-MotionTrigger

Trigger switches based on security sensors like motion or door sensors if
certain preconditions are met (eg. luminosity below a certain level). Lets you
specify  multiple devices to trigger and check, a delay for turning off lights
and multiple preconditions to check. This module will ensure that devices are
not triggered if any of the selected devices is already turned on.

# Configuration

## lights

Multiple devices that should be triggered. Trigger will not be fired if any
of these devices is already turned on.

## securitySensors

Security sensors that trigger lights. It is sufficient for one security
sensor to be triggered for the lights to be turned on.

## timeout

Trigger timeout duration after the last security sensor has been untripped.
(in seconds)

## preconditions√ç

Multiple optional conditions to check before a switch will be triggered.
Luminosity sensors, and the Astronomy module from
https://github.com/maros/Zway-Astronomy are particularly well suited to
be included in such condition checks. Can also be used to prevent triggering
lights if any other light is already switched on.

## preconditions.time.timeFrom, preconditions.time.timeTo, preconditions.time.dayofweek

Multiple time periods when the motion trigger should be active.
Time in HH:MM format

## preconditions.binary.device, preconditions.multilevel.device

Multiple devices to check. Must be either a binary or a multilevel sensor.

## preconditions.multilevel.device

Operators to be used for the multilevel checks

## preconditions.binary.value, preconditions.multilevel.value

Values to be used for the precondition checks

## preconditions.recheck

If this option is enabled, all preconditions will be rechecked regularly.
Otherwise preconditions will be only checked once when the light is about
to be triggered

## dimmer.mode, dimmer.static, dimmer.code, dimmer.dynamic

Sets how the dimmer level should be determined.

* Full: Sets dimmers to 100% (default)
* Static: Sets the dimmer level to a user-defined value
* Code: Executes a user-provided JavaScript code to calculate the dimmer level
* Dynamic: Calculate dimmer based on luminosity

## pollSensors

Poll sensors interval while triggered. Will not poll if empty or 0.

## delay

Optional delay to trigger lights.

# Virtual Devices

This module creates a virtual binary switch device to turn on/off the trigger.
Current operation mode (triggered, on, off) is indicated by the icon color.
metrics:level stores the mode of the trigger, and metrics:triggered weather
a device is currently triggered or not.

# Events

## light.on, light.off

Emits an event whenever a light is switched on or off. ie. Allows other
motion triggers, to act immediately after one trigger has been switched
off.

# Installation

Install the BaseModule from https://github.com/maros/Zway-BaseModule first

The prefered way of installing this module is via the "Zwave.me App Store"
available in 2.2.0 and higher. For stable module releases no access token is
required. If you want to test the latest pre-releases use 'k1_beta' as
app store access token.

For developers and users of older Zway versions installation via git is
recommended.

```shell
cd /opt/z-way-server/automation/userModules
git clone https://github.com/maros/Zway-MotionTrigger.git MotionTrigger --branch latest
```

To update or install a specific version
```shell
cd /opt/z-way-server/automation/userModules/MotionTrigger
git fetch --tags
# For latest released version
git checkout tags/latest
# For a specific version
git checkout tags/1.02
# For development version
git checkout -b master --track origin/master
```
